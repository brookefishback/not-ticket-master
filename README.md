# not-ticket-master
A basic ticketing software that utilizes user input to process a sale 

Project requirements:

An independent company has asked that you develop a “Ticketmaster Killer” app that is basically just ticketmaster but with a cooler name and no trademark violations.

#This app offers 3 different events for which a user can purchase tickets

#Once a user chooses an event, some personal details are collected

#Just when the user thinks they are done, they are informed that a convenience fee of 20% has been added, and the new total is displayed

#The user can choose to continue or cancel

#There is no need to write payment logic. Continue or Cancel should end the program.
